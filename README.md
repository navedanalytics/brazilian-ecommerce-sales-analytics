## Business Objectives

The analysis focuses on answering key business questions:

- How is revenue and order volume performing over time?
- Which states and product categories generate the most revenue?
- What is the average order value and order frequency per customer?
- Which customers are repeat or high-value buyers?
- How does delivery performance vary by state and month?
- What percentage of orders are delivered late?
- How does delivery time affect customer review scores?
- Which product categories contribute most to overall revenue?
- What factors are associated with higher or lower customer satisfaction?

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **Brazilian Olist E-Commerce dataset**, which contains information related to:

- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- Sellers
- Payments
- Reviews
- Order items
- Product categories
- Customer locations
- Delivery information

### Analysis Period

**2016–2018**

### Key Tables / Data Sources

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `orders` | Order status, purchase and delivery information |
| `customers` | Customer and geographic information |
| `order_items` | Product-level order transactions |
| `order_payments` | Payment information |
| `order_reviews` | Customer review scores |
| `products` | Product attributes and categories |
| `sellers` | Seller information |
| `product_category_name_translation` | Product category translation |

For analysis and dashboard development, the relevant datasets were cleaned and combined into an analytical dataset.

## Data Preparation

The data preparation process included:

- Handling missing values
- Removing or filtering invalid records where appropriate
- Standardizing column names and formats
- Converting date fields into usable date/month dimensions
- Creating delivery-time features
- Creating late-delivery indicators
- Translating product category names
- Aggregating item-level records to the appropriate **order level**
- Validating duplicated order-level attributes
- Preparing analytical tables for Power BI and SQL analysis

A major consideration in this project was that **one `order_id` can appear across multiple rows** because an order can contain multiple items. Therefore, order-level metrics were calculated carefully to avoid double counting.

---

# Key KPIs

The dashboard tracks business-focused KPIs such as:

- **Total Revenue**
- **total_orders**
- **Average Order Value**
- **Orders per Customer**
- **Average Delivery Days**
- **Average Review Score**
- **Average Freight Cost per Order**
- **Total Late Deliveries**
- **Total Orders Deliveries**
- **Late_Delivery**
- **Late Delivery %**
- **avg_freight_CostbyCategory**
- **avg_order_customer_state_freight**
- **sum_of_revenue_per_order**
- **sum_of_freight_per_order**
- **Total Customers**
- **Total Orders Deliveries**
- **Zero**



Example dashboard snapshot:

| KPI | Value |
|---|---:|

FROM olist_ecommerce_clean;
``` 

### Average Order Value

```sql
SELECT
    AVG(order_value) AS avg_order_value
FROM (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        SUM(total_price) AS order_value
    FROM olist_ecommerce_clean
    WHERE order_status = 'delivered'
    GROUP BY order_id
) AS t;
```

### Orders per Customer

    WHERE order_status = 'delivered'
      AND review_score IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY order_id
) AS t;
```

### Late Delivery %

```sql
SELECT
    SUM(total_late_deliveries) * 100.0 /
    COUNT(order_id) AS late_delivery_percent
FROM (
    SELECT
        order_id,
        MAX(Late_Delivery) AS total_late_deliveries
    FROM olist_ecommerce_clean
    WHERE order_status = 'delivered'

    rn
FROM (
    SELECT
        customer_state,
        product_category_name_english,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY customer_state
            ORDER BY SUM(total_price) DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM olist_ecommerce_clean
    WHERE order_status = 'delivered'

# Power BI / DAX

DAX was used to create dynamic measures and KPI calculations.

Examples include:

### Average Delivery Days

```DAX
Avg Delivery Days = AVERAGEX(summarize(filter('olist_ecommerce_clean','olist_ecommerce_clean'[order_status]=="delivered" && not(ISBLANK('olist_ecommerce_clean'[Delivery_Days]))),'olist_ecommerce_clean'[order_id],'olist_ecommerce_clean'[Purchase_Month],"Delivery_Days",MAX('olist_ecommerce_clean'[Delivery_Days])),[Delivery_Days])
```

### Average Review Score

```DAX
Avg Review Score = AVERAGEX(SUMMARIZE(FILTER('olist_ecommerce_clean','olist_ecommerce_clean'[order_status]="delivered" && not(isblank('olist_ecommerce_clean'[review_score]))),'olist_ecommerce_clean'[order_id] ,"Review Score",MAX('olist_ecommerce_clean'[review_score])),[Review Score])    
```

### Orders per Customer

```DAX
Orders Per Customer =
DIVIDE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('olist_ecommerce_clean'[order_id]),
    DISTINCTCOUNT('olist_ecommerce_clean'[customer_unique_id])
)
```

* The overall **average review score was around 4.0/5**, showing generally positive customer satisfaction.

### 2. Revenue & Sales Trends

* Revenue showed noticeable month-to-month fluctuations, with **stronger performance during the middle of the year** and a significant decline toward the end of the observed period.
* Order volume followed a similar seasonal pattern, indicating that sales activity was not evenly distributed throughout the year.
* The business should investigate the causes of high-performing months and replicate successful promotional or seasonal strategies.

### 3. Geographic Performance

* **São Paulo (SP)** was the strongest-performing state, generating approximately **R$5.92M in revenue** and more than **41K orders**.
* **Rio de Janeiro (RJ)** and **Minas Gerais (MG)** were the next major contributors, with approximately **R$2.13M** and **R$1.86M** in revenue respectively.
* Revenue and order volume are highly concentrated in a small number of states, suggesting that these regions are the platform's primary markets.

### 4. Customer Purchasing Behavior

* Customers placed approximately **1.03 orders per customer**, indicating that most customers made only a small number of purchases during the period.
* **Afternoon orders were the highest**, with roughly **32K orders**, followed by evening, morning, and night.
* This suggests that marketing campaigns, promotions, and customer engagement activities could be prioritized during high-traffic periods.

### 5. Product Performance

* Product revenue is concentrated among several major categories, with categories such as **health & beauty, watches & gifts, bed & bath, sports & leisure, and computers/accessories** among the important contributors.
* The product-category analysis shows that a relatively small group of categories contributes a substantial portion of overall revenue.
* This indicates an opportunity to focus inventory planning, promotions, and cross-selling strategies on high-performing categories.

### 6. Customer Satisfaction

* The majority of orders received **high review scores**, with approximately **57K orders receiving a 5-star rating**.
* However, lower review scores are still present, creating an opportunity to investigate the reasons behind dissatisfied customers.
* Delivery experience appears to be an important area to investigate because longer delivery times can negatively affect customer satisfaction.
